= {repository-name} Library for Arduino =

This Arduino library allows you to send and receive data using the **RS-485** interface standard. Supported by all Arduino-compatible boards such as ESP32, STM32, RP2040, AVR, SAMD, ESP8266, etc. You can use both hardware and software serial ports for communication. This library supports the Maxim Integrated **MAX485** and equivalent transceivers.

Three examples are included with this library:

  * **RS485_Sender** - Sends data to a connected receiver.
  * **RS485_Receiver** - Receives data from a connected sender.
  * **RS485_Passthrough** - Sends and receives data between the RS-485 port and the default serial port.

This library is a fork of the **ArduinoRS485** library by Arduino, and is maintained by **CIRCUITSTATE Electronics**.
